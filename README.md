# Scattering of Non-Reactive Ultracold Molecules

Code from my research with Prof. Kaden Hazzard. This project contains Mathematica Notebooks for our paper on Non-reactive molecules scattering and resonating with bound states. 
This code led to plots in our published papers, which are subject to additional licenses.

Currently, only uploading code for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble.
